Section (1) - PROJECT INFORMATION
---------------------------------
Name      = camera_simple_frame_buffer
Directory = /home/wbraun/camera_simple_frame_buffer

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the
         current project. The path may point to an invalid location after opening this project.
         This could happen if the project was unarchived in a location where this path is not
         accessible. To resolve this issue, please set this property with the desired path
         before launching simulation:-

Property = compxlib.xsim_compiled_library_dir
Path     = /home/wbraun/camera_simple_frame_buffer/camera_simple_frame_buffer.cache/compile_simlib/xsim

Section (2) - Excluded Runs
---------------------------
The run results were excluded for the following runs in the archived project:-

<synth_1>
<frame_buffer_synth_1>
<video_clk_synth_1>

<frame_buffer_impl_1>
<video_clk_impl_1>
