INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/afs/athena.mit.edu/user/s/h/shreeyam/Documents/6.111/6111/6111work/Project/baseline_test/baseline_test/baseline_test.srcs/constrs_1/imports/baseline_test/Nexys4DDR_Master_lab5c.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/labkit_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/labkit_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
